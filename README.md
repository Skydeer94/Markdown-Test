## Civil Enginner 🏦/ Web Developer 💻/ Front End 💡/ Full Stack in progress 👨‍💻


### ***PROFILE***

I am a front end developer and civil engineer with four years of experience in development and building of different kinds of buildings in some Colombian cities.

I have led projects with social focusing, I have stood out due to quick decision making in situations that need it, and a great human resources management to accomplish with stablished targets and stipulated time from project beginning.

Currently I am starting my career as a web developer with some freelance projects as a front-end developer, besides that, I am part of a fullback JavaScript bootcamp where the own work is combined with the team work between senior and junior developers, all of this with efficient and actual use apps. I am eager of beginning my professional and personal growth process in a company of the field.
